I'm a frontend developer passionate about bringing ideas to life through code. I enjoy writing clean, detail-oriented code and take pride in crafting smooth, pixel-perfect user experiences.

💼 I'm currently open to **mid-level frontend roles**, either **remote** or **based in Berlin**.

## 💻 What I'm working on:

I'm currently building and optimizing personal projects to apply what I've recently learned, sharpen my problem-solving skills in real-world scenarios, and prepare myself for upcoming job opportunities.
